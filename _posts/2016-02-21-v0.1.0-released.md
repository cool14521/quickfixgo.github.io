title: QuickFIX/Go v0.1.0 Released
---

We have our first release!

Here is what you can do with v0.1.0:

* Pass all FIX Acceptance tests demonstrating FIX session management
* Support for Server and Client FIX Applications
* FIX Message Validation
* Repeating Groups
* Generated message types for FIX4.0 - FIX5.0sp2

Our current roadmap is to broaden the library for fully supporting production quality FIX applications.  This includes implementing many of the configuration options currently available for QuickFIX, QuickFIX/n, and QuickFIX/j.

QuickFIX/Go will be released subject to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).  Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable, however, we do not expect any *major* world breaking changes should you decide to start writing apps with QuickFIX/Go.

Check out the [docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix) and [examples](https://github.com/quickfixgo/examples) to get started. Bug reports, bug fixes and pull requests are very welcome!
