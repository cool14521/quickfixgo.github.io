QuickFIX/Go v0.5.0 Released! 

v0.5.0 is by far the biggest QuickFIX/Go release yet.  Changes of note in this release:

* Daily and weekly session scheduling
* Integrated SSL support
* Failover and high availability features
* Decimal support for float FIX field types
* A number of bug fixes

See the [Release Notes](https://github.com/quickfixgo/quickfix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
for a complete list of changes in v0.5.0.

QuickFIX/Go will be released subject to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).  Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable, however, we do not expect any *major* world breaking changes should you decide to start writing apps with QuickFIX/Go.

Check out the [docs](/docs) and [examples](https://github.com/quickfixgo/examples) to get started. Bug reports, bug fixes and pull requests are very welcome!
